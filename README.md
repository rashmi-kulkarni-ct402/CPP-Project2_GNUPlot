Project 2_GNUPlot_Inheritance_30Jan2024

Instructions:
Take input from the user in length.
Process the input and write in file as coordinates
Feed output to GNU plot tool to visualize the shapes
Must - Point class & Shape Base class
Must - Implement hierarchy (inheritance)

Steps:
Create Shape as a base class
Create derived classed of Shape class (these classes will also include the header file of Point class)
Override virtual methods from Shape class to all derived classes
Calculate lengths to coordinates and write data in file
Use the saved data from file to visualize 2D shapes in GNU plot

Hierarchy of classes: 
a. Shape -> Line
b. Shape -> Triangle
c. Shape -> Rectangle -> Square
d. Shape -> Ellipse -> Circle
